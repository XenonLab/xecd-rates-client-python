# XE Currency Data Client - Python

XE.com Inc. is the World's Trusted Currency Authority. This project provides an SDK to interface with our XE Currency Data (XECD) product.

XE Currency Data is a REST API that gives you access to daily or live rates and historic mid-market conversion rates between all of our supported currencies.

You will need an api key and secret to use this sdk. Sign up for a [free trial][4] or register for a [full account][5].

This client will work with both python2 and python3.

## Installation

The preferred way to install this package is through Github.

```
TODO
pip install >github link<
```
```
pip install >package name when published to pip<>
```

This package follows [semantic versioning][3].

## Usage

```python
from XecdClient import XecdClient

xecd = XecdClient('accountId', 'apiKey')


response = xecd.account_info()
#do stuff with response
response = xecd.currencies()
response = xecd.convert_from("EUR", "CAD", 55)
response = xecd.convert_to("RUB", "CAD", 55)
response = xecd.historic_rate("2016-12-25", "12:34", "EUR", "CAD", 55)
response = xecd.historic_rate_period(55, "EUR", "RUB", "2016-02-28T12:00", "2016-03-03T12:00")
response = xecd.monthly_average(55, "CAD", "EUR", 2017, 5)
```

## Testing

```bash
python3 -m test.UnitTest
python3 -m test.IntegrationTest
python -m test.IntegrationTest
```

Note: the UnitTest must be ran with python3 due to its use of unittest.mock (which is not present as of python2.7). Despite this, the client itself is usable with both python 2 and 3.
